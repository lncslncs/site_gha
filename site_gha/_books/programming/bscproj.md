# BSc Project

In my final year at university I am looking into long term structure in computer generated music. I'm exploring how Machine Learning, more specifically Recurrent Neural Networks, can be used to model emotional arc and structure within pieces of music. 

I'm writing a blog about my progress with this project which you can find here.
