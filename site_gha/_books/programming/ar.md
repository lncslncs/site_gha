# Augmented Reality AI Receptionist
## 2019 - 2020

I worked on an industry exchange project with IBM to build at AR Receptionist using IBM Watson technology. As the Team Lead of a three person team, I was responsible for managing our workflow, and ensuring a smooth team dynamic, as well as communicating with our supervisor at IBM. We built a custom pipeline to build a cross platform mobile application, including Unity Game Engine, IBM Cloud, and Amazon lambda webhooks. I became familiar with C# programming in Unity, and the Unity AR Foundation package.
